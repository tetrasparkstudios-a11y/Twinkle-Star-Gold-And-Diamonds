I already have a working TwinkleStar website generated by you. The design, theme, layout, and styling are exactly how I want them.
➡️ Do NOT change the visuals, theme, fonts, layout, or existing components.
Now I only want to add functionality:

A simple admin section to manage products (add / edit / delete).

The Products / Collections and Product Details pages must load data from the database / API, so any admin changes automatically appear on the live site.

A reviews section on each product detail page with user reviews and ratings.

1️⃣ Data & Backend Structure (Products)

Create a proper data model for products and connect it to a small backend (Node/Express or whatever stack you already used):

Product fields (minimum):

id (unique)

slug (for product URL, auto-generated from name)

name

category (e.g., Coin, Bar, Jewelry, Diamond, Collection)

metalType (Gold, Silver, Diamond, Mixed)

purity (e.g., “24K 999.9”)

weight (e.g., “10g”)

price (number)

currency (e.g., “INR”)

images (array of URLs)

stockStatus (In Stock / Limited / Out of Stock)

shortDescription

description (full details shown on product page)

isFeatured (boolean – for home page & carousels)

tags (array: e.g., “festival”, “gift”, “best-seller”)

festivalOffer (optional text or badge, shown in “Special offers” area)

createdAt, updatedAt

You can store this in a database (e.g. SQLite/Postgres) or a JSON file if you must, but front-end must read from this source, not hardcoded HTML.

API endpoints (example, adjust to your stack):

GET /api/products → list with filters (query params: category, metalType, minPrice, maxPrice, featured, search).

GET /api/products/:slug → single product detail.

POST /api/products → create product (admin only).

PUT /api/products/:id → update product (admin only).

DELETE /api/products/:id → delete product (admin only).

Make sure CORS & security are correct if needed, but it can be same-origin since this is one app.

2️⃣ Admin Panel (Products Management)

Add an /admin section with a simple login (email + password, hardcoded is fine for now):

Route: /admin/login → simple login page

Route: /admin/products → product list

Route: /admin/products/new → create form

Route: /admin/products/:id/edit → edit form

Admin UI requirements:

Match existing theme (dark, elegant, silver accents, tiny gold hints).

Use same typography and spacing system. It should feel like an internal TwinkleStar dashboard, not a different app.

Product list table/grid: show name, category, price, stock, last updated, with Edit/Delete actions.

Add Product / Edit Product forms:

Input fields for all product fields listed above.

Image URL inputs or upload if supported.

Toggle for isFeatured.

Textareas for descriptions.

When admin creates or updates a product:

Save to database.

The public product list and product pages must use this updated data without code changes.

Important:

If I add or update a product in the admin panel, it must automatically reflect on:

Home page feature sections

Products / Collections page

Product details page
Everywhere products appear, they should be fetched from the same product data source.

3️⃣ Frontend Changes (Products List & Details)

Do NOT restyle anything. Just make the source dynamic.

Products / Collections page:

Replace any hardcoded product cards with data fetched from GET /api/products.

Keep all existing filters and grid layout exactly the same visually, but they should now filter using the dynamic data.

Filters:

Category, Metal Type, Purity, Weight, Price Range, Tags, etc.

When filters change, call the API or filter on the client using the loaded list.

Use loading states (skeletons) that fit the theme while data is being fetched.

Product Details page:

Replace hardcoded content with data from GET /api/products/:slug.

Show all details from the product model:

Name, price, weight, purity, images, description, tags, stock, etc.

Keep the existing "Special offer / Festival offers" area but populate any dynamic promo text from the product’s festivalOffer field if present.

4️⃣ Reviews / Ratings Section (Per Product)

Add a Reviews section to every product detail page.

Review model:

id

productId (foreign key to product)

name (reviewer name — can be simple text, no real auth needed)

rating (1–5 stars)

title (short headline)

comment (full text)

createdAt

API endpoints:

GET /api/products/:id/reviews → list reviews for that product (sorted newest first).

POST /api/products/:id/reviews → submit new review (public, but validate).

(Optional) DELETE /api/reviews/:id → remove review (admin only, via admin panel Reviews tab).

Front-end (product detail page):

Show an Average Rating (e.g., 4.5 ★) and total reviews count.

Show a list of reviews in the same dark/elegant style:

Name, star rating, title, comment, date.

Use silver stars and subtle gold accent for high ratings (e.g., average badge).

Add a “Write a Review” form:

Fields: Name, Rating (1–5), Title, Comment.

Basic validation: required fields, rating between 1–5, limit comment length.

On submit:

Send to POST /api/products/:id/reviews.

Show success or error message.

Append the newly created review to the list without full page reload.

Anti-spam basics (no need for heavy stuff):

Add a hidden honeypot field (must stay empty).

Limit how often the same IP/browser can post (simple time-based check).

Admin handling of reviews (optional but preferred):

In /admin, add a “Reviews” section or integrate into product edit:

See all reviews for a product.

Option to delete or hide inappropriate reviews.

5️⃣ Keep Theme, Layout & Animations Exactly As-Is

Do not change the existing design, fonts, colors, or layout.

All new admin pages and review components must match the current TwinkleStar theme:

Dark background

Silver as main accent

Very subtle gold highlights

Reuse button styles, card styles, typography scales, etc.

Keep existing animations and micro-interactions; use the same style for new elements.

6️⃣ Technical Expectations / Deliverables

Fully wired backend (or mock backend) so that:

New product from admin → appears automatically on Products page & relevant carousels.

Edited product details → update automatically site-wide.

Deleted product → removed from listings and cannot be opened by slug.

Reviews stored and fetched per product.

Clean, commented code where new logic is added.

A short ADMIN-NOTES.md or README.md explaining:

How to log into admin.

How to add/edit products.

How reviews are stored and how to moderate/delete them.
